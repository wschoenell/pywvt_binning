WVT Binning is a generalization of Cappellari & Copin's Voronoi binning
algorithm. If you find this algorithm useful for you analysis, we ask you to
cite both papers, e.g. "We made use of the WVT binning algorithm by Diehl &
Statler (2006), which is a generalization of Cappellari & Copin's (2003)
Voronoi binning algorithm."
